## High-performance acoustic simulation

This solver is be capable of accurately and efficiently computing the propagation of 
sound waves in complex geometries and through various materials with varying acoustic 
properties. This is achieved by incorporating finite element analysis. 

The code is optimized for high performance computing, utilizing parallel 
processing solutions to make use of the processing power of modern CPU's and GPU's. 

The program has an user-friendly and flexible interface, allowing for easy integration into 
other FWI implementations and enabling the simulation of a wide range of acoustic scenarios.
